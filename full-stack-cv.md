Senior Full Stack Engineer | React, Next.js, Node.js | E-commerce &
Product Systems | Built US$90K+ in Online Sales
São Paulo, Brazil
Summary
I’m a Senior Full Stack Engineer who has built and operated a
profitable e-commerce platform generating over US$90,000 in
total sales, alongside 5+ years of hands-on experience developing
production-grade web applications.
I specialize in building scalable, high-performance frontend
architectures, robust backend services, and custom business
logic for e-commerce, SaaS products, and internal platforms,
with a strong focus on React, Next.js, Node.js, and modern
commerce ecosystems. My work consistently balances clean code,
performance, UX, and measurable business impact.
What I work with:
Frontend: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, performance
optimization, responsive and accessible UI
Backend & APIs: Node.js, Express, REST APIs, GraphQL, Prisma,
SQL-based systems
E-commerce & Platforms: Shopify (Liquid, Headless, Hydrogen),
custom checkout logic, CRO, AOV optimization
Infrastructure & Tooling: Docker, CI/CD pipelines, Git/GitHub, cloud
platforms (AWS, GCP, Firebase)
I’ve worked in international, fully remote environments, collaborating
with cross-functional teams and taking ownership of features end-to-
end — from architecture and implementation to production delivery
and continuous optimization.
Beyond client and team-based roles, I’ve founded and scaled my
own e-commerce business, owning the entire technical stack,
automation, and integrations. This experience shaped a strong
product- and business-oriented engineering mindset, allowing me to
make technical decisions aligned with real-world outcomes.
