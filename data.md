Summary
I’m a Full Stack Software Engineer with 5+ years of hands-on
experience building and operating production-grade web applications
and revenue-generating digital platforms, including a profitable e-
commerce business with over US$90,000 in total sales.
I specialize in designing scalable, high-performance frontend
architectures and robust backend services, delivering custom
business logic for e-commerce platforms, SaaS products, and
internal systems. My work consistently balances clean, maintainable
code with performance, UX, and measurable business impact, with
a strong focus on React, Next.js, Node.js, and modern product
ecosystems.
What I work with:
Frontend: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, performance
optimization, responsive and accessible UI
Backend & APIs: Node.js, Express, REST APIs, GraphQL, Prisma,
SQL-based systems
E-commerce & Platforms: Shopify (Liquid, Headless, Hydrogen),
custom checkout logic, CRO, AOV optimization
Infrastructure & Tooling: Docker, CI/CD pipelines, Git/GitHub, cloud
platforms (AWS, GCP, Firebase)
I’ve worked in international, fully remote environments, collaborating
with cross-functional teams and taking full ownership of features
end-to-end — from system design and implementation to production
deployment and continuous optimization.
Beyond client and team-based roles, I’ve also founded and scaled
my own product, owning the entire technical stack, automation,
and integrations. This experience shaped a strong product- and
business-oriented engineering mindset, enabling me to make
technical decisions aligned with real-world constraints, scalability,
and long-term outcomes.
