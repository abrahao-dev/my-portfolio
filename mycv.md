Matheus Abrahão
iOS Software Engineer | Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, MVVM | Building
Production iOS Apps
São Paulo, Brazil
Summary
I am an iOS Software Engineer focused on building and shipping
real-world mobile applications, from architecture design to App Store
delivery.
I work primarily with Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, and MVVM, developing
native iOS apps with a strong emphasis on clean architecture,
performance, scalability, and long-term maintainability. My approach
prioritizes predictable codebases, excellent user experience, and
strict alignment with Apple platform best practices.
I have hands-on experience delivering production iOS applications,
including independent apps published on the App Store, open-
source contributions, and collaborative projects within distributed
teams. I have worked across the full product lifecycle, covering UI
development, business logic, local data persistence, notifications,
widgets, localization, and deployment.
With a background in Computer Engineering, I bring a solid
foundation in data structures, systems, and software design,
which I apply daily to mobile development. I am comfortable taking
technical ownership, collaborating closely with designers and
backend engineers, and translating product requirements into well-
engineered, maintainable solutions.
I am currently open to remote opportunities as an iOS Software
Engineer, where engineering quality, product thinking, and real user
impact are valued.
Experience
Greenstand
iOS Developer
October 2025 - Present (4 months)
Estados Unidos

As an iOS Software Engineer at Greenstand — a U.S.-based organization
developing open-source technology to fight climate change and alleviate
poverty — I contribute to the mobile development of the Treetracker and Wallet
ecosystem.

I work with Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, MVVM and Clean Architecture to enhance and
expand the mobile experience used by field workers and partner organizations
around the world. My focus is delivering reliable, scalable and user-centered
features that support ecological impact tracking and transparency across
reforestation initiatives.

In collaboration with a distributed engineering team, I participate in issue
analysis, task refinement, feature implementation and GitHub-based
workflows. I also explore continuous integration improvements, automated
testing and best practices for modern iOS and open-source development.

Technologies and tools I work with include:

Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, Combine
MVVM, Clean Architecture
Git, GitHub, PR workflows
Expo, React Native (as needed for cross-platform tasks)
CI/CD, automated tests, integration with open-source pipelines
Being part of Greenstand allows me to apply my iOS expertise to a global-
impact project while continuously improving as an engineer in an international,
collaborative, mission-driven environment.
